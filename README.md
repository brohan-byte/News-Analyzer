# News Trend Analysis Pipeline

This project implements an **automated news scraping and analysis system** that collects news articles from the web using **Selenium**, applies **natural language processing (NLP)** with **NLTK**, and visualizes trends using **Matplotlib**.

## Overview
The system automates web browsing to scrape news articles from multiple sources, processes the text data to extract meaningful insights, and generates visualizations to highlight trends in news coverage over time.

## Features
- Automated web scraping using **Selenium**
- Extraction of headlines and article content
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)
- NLP-based trend and keyword analysis using **NLTK**
- Visualization of trends with **Matplotlib**
- Modular and extensible pipeline

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Selenium** – web automation and scraping
- **NLTK** – natural language processing
- **Matplotlib** – data visualization
- **BeautifulSoup** (optional, if used)
- **Pandas** (optional, if used)

## NLP Processing
- Tokenization and normalization
- Stopword removal
- Frequency and keyword analysis
- Trend extraction across time or sources

## How It Works
1. Selenium automates browsing and collects news articles.
2. Scraped text is cleaned and preprocessed.
3. NLTK analyzes textual data to extract keywords and trends.
4. Matplotlib visualizes patterns in news coverage.
